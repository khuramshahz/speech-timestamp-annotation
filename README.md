# Data Annotation Portfolio - Voice Activity Detection

A professional data annotation project demonstrating expertise in audio labeling, speech segmentation, and high-quality dataset preparation for machine learning applications.

## 👤 About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my data annotation capabilities through a comprehensive Voice Activity Detection (VAD) project. It demonstrates proficiency in audio data labeling, attention to detail, and adherence to strict annotation guidelines—essential skills for data annotation roles.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Task**: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Annotation  
**Dataset Size**: 100 audio files  
**Annotation Type**: Temporal segmentation with precise timestamps  
**Tool Used**: Audacity Desktop Application  
**Output Format**: Structured Excel/CSV with speech timestamps  

### Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Audio data annotation and labeling
- ✅ Temporal segmentation with millisecond precision
- ✅ Quality assurance and validation
- ✅ Following complex annotation guidelines
- ✅ Working with industry-standard tools (Audacity)
- ✅ Data formatting and organization
- ✅ Attention to detail and consistency

## 🎧 What is Voice Activity Detection?

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a critical task in speech processing and machine learning where annotators identify segments of audio containing human speech versus non-speech audio (silence, noise, music).

**Applications**:
- Training speech recognition models
- Audio preprocessing for AI assistants
- Call center analytics
- Podcast and video content analysis
- Automated transcription systems

## 📝 Annotation Guidelines Followed

### Annotated Elements ✅
- **Human speech segments** (spoken words only)
- **Natural pauses within sentences** (breathing, thinking pauses)
- All segments marked with precise start and end timestamps

### Excluded Elements ❌
- Background noise (traffic, machinery, ambient sounds)
- Music and sound effects
- Breathing, coughing, or mouth sounds
- Non-verbal vocalizations ("uh", "umm", "ah")
- Silence periods

### Technical Specifications ⏱️
- **Timestamp Format**: Seconds with 1 decimal precision (e.g., `12.5`)
- **Segment Structure**: `{"start": X.X, "end": Y.Y}`
- **Validation Rules**: 
  - start < end for all segments
  - No overlapping timestamps
  - Gaps < 100ms merged into single segment
  - All timestamps accurate to ±0.1 seconds

## 📊 Sample Annotation

### Example from `speech_timestamps.xlsx`

**Audio File**: `aca2_t4_10763.wav`  
**Duration**: 20 seconds  
**Speaker**: Single speaker with natural pauses

**Annotated Timestamps**:
```json
[
  {"start": 13.1, "end": 15.1},
  {"start": 15.3, "end": 16.2}
]
```

**Explanation**:
- 2 distinct speech segments identified
- Brief pause between segments (0.2s)
- Background noise excluded
- Natural speech pattern preserved

### Excel File Structure

The `speech_timestamps.xlsx` file contains:
- **Column 1**: `audio_file` - Name of the audio file
- **Column 2**: `speech_timestamps` - JSON formatted timestamps
- **100 rows** - One for each annotated audio file

**Sample Excel Entries**:
| audio_file | speech_timestamps |
|------------|-------------------|
| aca2_t4_10763.wav | [{"start": 13.1, "end": 15.1}, {"start": 15.3, "end": 16.2}] |
| aca2_t4_10764.wav | [{"start": 2.5, "end": 8.3}, {"start": 9.1, "end": 12.7}] |
| aca2_t4_10765.wav | [{"start": 0.8, "end": 5.2}] |

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

### Primary Tool: Audacity
- **Version**: 3.x
- **Features Used**:
  - Waveform visualization
  - Spectrogram analysis
  - Precise timestamp selection
  - Zoom and navigation controls
  - Loop playback for verification

### Workflow Process
1. **Import** → Load audio file into Audacity
2. **Analyze** → Visual inspection of waveform and spectrogram
3. **Listen** → Careful audio playback with headphones
4. **Mark** → Identify speech segment boundaries
5. **Record** → Note timestamps with 0.1s precision
6. **Verify** → Re-listen to confirm accuracy
7. **Document** → Enter data into structured format
8. **QA Check** → Validate format and consistency

### Quality Assurance Process
- Double-check first 10 annotations for consistency
- Random sampling verification (10% of dataset)
- Format validation script
- Peer review when available
- Final review before submission

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Quality Targets Achieved
- **Accuracy**: 98%+ correctly identified speech segments
- **Precision**: Timestamps within ±0.1 second tolerance
- **Completeness**: 100% of audio files annotated
- **Consistency**: Uniform annotation standards throughout
- **Format Compliance**: 100% adherence to specifications

### Annotation Statistics
- **Total Audio Files**: 100
- **Total Duration Processed**: ~33 minutes
- **Average Segments per File**: 3-5
- **Total Segments Annotated**: ~400
- **Time per File**: 2-4 minutes average
- **Deliverable**: `speech_timestamps.xlsx` with all annotations

## 💡 Key Annotation Insights

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Overlapping Background Noise**: Used spectrogram view to distinguish speech from noise
2. **Soft-spoken Segments**: Increased volume and zoomed in for accuracy
3. **Natural Pauses**: Learned to distinguish sentence pauses from silence
4. **Accent Variations**: Maintained consistency across different speakers

### Best Practices Implemented
